# COLLECTOR-SAHAB EXPERIMENTS

This repo contains the results of our experiments with [COLLECTOR-SAHAB](https://github.com/algomaster99/collector-sahab/).

## Effectiveness

Output of running COLLECTOR-SAHAB on MVN-DRR patches are generated using [PatchExplainer](https://github.com/khaes-kth/PatchExplainer). These outputs are saved in the `sahab-diff-reports` folder. For `depth={i}`, the `sahab-diff-reports/d{i}/output` contains the generated augmented diffs in the `state_diffs` folder.

Also, results of didiffff per patch are listed in [this link](https://github.com/khaes-kth/didiffff-drr/blob/master/results/aggregated-res.csv).
